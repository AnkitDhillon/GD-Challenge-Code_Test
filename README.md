# Booming Games Code Challenge Project
Project made using pixiJS and Typescript (Only! No other libraries used)
And
Using the amazing build tool [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for seamlessly bundling and optimizing the project and making it ready for browser!

# Project preview link

# Controls
- Arrow keys to move
- Space to shoot
- 'T' to change tank

# To run the project locally
-npm install
-npm run start - starts a local server in dev mode with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
-go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser.

* `npm run start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time in dev mode with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
* `npm run build` - runs the compiler once and generates a production build.
* `npm run build_serve` - it makes a build and serves it to port 8080.

P.S. I made this project in some hours over an evening after work, so as I read in design doc that user experience and game polish won't be evaluated, I left out tweens, particles, effects and other eye candy stuff. And only focused on a working, bug-free, extendable and easy to modify/understand code in the limited time I had.  And if you wanna see my finished polished projects, I have included a link to them in my initial job application.

Was a fun little project to make, thanks! and wishing you a good day =)
